## Fact Claims - is your data trustworthy?

Our goal is to enrich the world with data that is relevant, licensed, and trustable at planetary-scale.

Recently, mediocre web content has experienced exponential growth - bulk-automated by generative AI. 

If our future AI are trained on this - we can expect increasingly lower-quality halluciations.

Ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of our AI systems is important:

### Fact Architecture:

- **Valid Facts:** For a fact to be considered valid, it needs to be associated with a specific action or entity and generated by a particular process.

- **Traceable Facts:** These facts can be traced back to their source through connections established during their creation or association.

- **Grounded Facts:** Grounded facts are securely stored in an unchangeable document, ensuring their reliability and verification.

- **Published Facts:** Published facts are online for reference, they need not be immutable so may be real time.

- **Notarized Facts:** Notarized facts with a trusted chain of custody, with provenance traced back to a digital trustee.
