# Web 3.0: Facts vs Smart Contracts

We need web 3.0 to be a web that we can trust, or we risk being washed away by torrents of disinformation.

Since the dawn of the century, web 3.0 has promised to reshape how we engage with information and value online. 

It's probably lost on most readers, but the two principle claimants to `web 3.0` are in mild dispute. 

There are two contenders for one crown: Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Smart Contracts. 

Let's (re)imagine them as `fact webs` and `trust chains` respectively. 

## RDF and Smart Contracts: What is Web 3.0 ?

Imagine a mind map branching out to represent knowledge, interconnected with meaning - a web of facts.

As the language of linked data, RDF went largely unnoticed, quietly laying the groundwork for a semantic revolution.

Some enterprise readers may recall the semantic web or knowledge graphs, abstract ideas that we grasp better than we think.

It will surprise very few that all of these AI, GPTs and LLMs understands this stuff too.

Far fewer, that RDF was also dubbed "Web 3.0", back in the early 2000s, a decade before the crypto-community reimagined and rebranded it. 

RDFs legacy lives-on in SEO and the rich snippets that still power the Web 2.0 clouds and social networks - giant private knowledge graphs.

Maybe together, they hint at a solution to the trust crisis ?

## Semantic Trust Chains: Enforcers of Trust

Smart contracts, our second contender, emerged as blockchain's powerhouse, ensuring transparent and autonomous transactions.

Smart contracts enforce trust in Web 3.0 transactions, eliminating intermediaries and executing agreements autonomously.

Trust chains on the blockchain extend this idea by establishing verifiable provenance, a decentralized web of trusted facts.

Integrating smart contracts with fact graphs enhances accountability, enabling autonomous decisions based on verifiable information.

Together, they move us closer to realizing a decentralized and trustworthy internet.

## Architecting Trust: An Alliance

RDF's semantic interoperability and smart contracts' decentralized governance can unite to form the bedrock of trust in Web 3.0. 

The trusted web can empower both human and AI users to navigate with confidence and certainty.

The immutable, tamper-proof IPFS (Interplanetary File System) stores facts forever.

## It's all there already, only two tiny steps to go ...

1) Publish a few dozen permanent RDF snippets to IPFS to mint a permanent identifier.

2) Transmit the identifier as part of any smart contract event.

An immutable fact graph on IPFS and an assertion on the blockchain, linked to your private key.

## A Trust-Centric Future or Post-Truth?

If RDF and smart contracts define Web 3.0, then trust and transparency can emerge as early key benefits of the AI era.

On the shoulders of these giants, an inch closer to, a future we can trust.
