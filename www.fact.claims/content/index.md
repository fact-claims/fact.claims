# A Web of Facts for Trustworthy AI


**[Publish your (free) fact claims](/facts/)**

## Introducing `fact.claims`:

- **Valid Facts:** Associated with a specific action or entity and generated by a particular process.

- **Traceable Facts:** Sourced through connections established during their creation or association.

- **Grounded Facts:** Stored forever, reliably ensuring their verification.

- **Published Facts:** Online for reference, they need not be immutable, they may be real time.

- **Notarized Facts:** A traceable chain of custody, trusted and signed by a digital trustee.
