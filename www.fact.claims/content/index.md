# Trustworthy AI needs facts

We believe AI needs to trained on curated, `trustable` data so it is `grounded` and trustworthy:

- **You can help [AI agents](/howto/crawling) to find, verify and collaborate on [your facts](/web/self)**
- **Join in ... fact claims are easy to create, tamper-proof, decentralized and [forever free](/claim/)** .

Are you are launching a product, creating content, running a business or publishing research ...?

## Introducing fact.claims

- **[Specific](/claim/):** Associated with a unique action or entity and generated by a particular process.

- **[Traceable](/claim/):** Sourced through connections established during their creation or association.

- **[Published](/claim/):** Online for reference, they may be real time, they may go away.

- **[Grounded](/claim/):** Stored forever, with a tamper-proof fingerprint, ensuring reliable verification.

- **[Notarized](/claim/):** A traceable chain of custody, trusted and signed by a blockchain trustee.

## The technicalities:
