## 1. Introduction

Given rapidly evolving artificial intelligence (AI), the need for trustworthy and immutable data has become paramount. 

Decentralized ecosystems, built upon principles of transparency, auditability, and reliability, require robust mechanisms for managing and verifying information exchange. In this context, the establishment of fact claims - assertions of truth or validity regarding specific entities, relationships, or events - plays a crucial role in facilitating trustful collaboration across autonomous decentralized ecosystems.

The fact claims ecosystem serves as the backbone for managing trusted collaborations and value exchange in diverse domains, including research, innovation, curation, collaboration, and creativity. It encompasses a wide range of activities, from asserting research findings and coordinating project activities to managing legal contracts and tracking supply chain transactions. However, ensuring transparency, accountability, and interoperability within such a trustful ecosystem requires a standardized approach for representing facts - a knowledge graph.

Traditional centralized storage solutions, while effective in some contexts, pose several challenges in decentralized environments. These challenges include single points of failure, data manipulation risks, and vulnerabilities to censorship and tampering. In contrast, decentralized technologies offer innovative solutions to address these challenges and enhance the integrity and auditability of fact claims.

This RFC proposes a methodology for leveraging the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Linked Data (JSON-LD), and Smart Contracts to construct a trusted network of fact graphs. By harnessing the distributed, immutable, and censorship-resistant nature of IPFS, we aim to address the challenges associated with decentralized trust and establish a reliable repository for storing and accessing fact claims. Through the use of JSON-LD, we ensure semantic interoperability and compatibility, enabling machine-readable representation and interpretation of fact claims. Additionally, Smart Contracts provide governance mechanisms for managing the lifecycle of fact claims, ensuring transparency, and enforcing trust among participants.

The technical architecture outlined in this RFC provides a blueprint for integrating IPFS into existing systems to establish a tamper-resistant repository for storing and accessing fact claims. By adopting standard ontologies such as PROV-O, SKOS, and VOID, we enhance interoperability and facilitate knowledge organization within the ecosystem. Furthermore, the validation mechanisms outlined in this RFC ensure compliance with predefined constraints and rules, ensuring data integrity and consistency across fact graphs.

In the following sections, we delve deeper into the objectives, technical details, use cases, security considerations, and implementation strategies for constructing trusted fact claims. 

Through this RFC, we aim to lay the groundwork for a future where collaboration thrives securely and reliably, fostering innovation, transparency, and trust among participants.

## 3. Fact Claims Protocol

The `fact graph` describes how fact claims are represented as linked data serialized in JSON-LD format. 

JSON-LD provides a lightweight and flexible means to express semantic information in a structured and easily understandable manner. 

By following these steps, the Fact Claim protocol ensures the integrity, transparency, and traceability of asserted claims.

### 3.1. **Create Factual Claims in RDF Format**

- 3.1.1 Define the factual claims using RDF format.

```turtle
@prefix prov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#> .

<https://fact.claims/> prov:generated <https://example.claims/facts/claim1>.

<https://example.claims/facts/claim1> prov:wasAttributedTo <ethereum://0x123abc...> .
```

- 3.1.2. Make useful and necessary assertions with reference to relevant ontologies.

```json-ld
<https://example.claims/facts/claim1>

    rdf:label 'fact claim #1';
    
    rdf:comment 'Trusted Facts for Autonomous Agents'.
```

### 3.2. **Attribution to Ethereum Smart Contract Address**

- 3.2.1. Embed `prov:wasAttributedTo` within the RDF claims to the Ethereum smart contract address (`ethereum://0x123abc...`) serving as the originating entity.

- 3.2.2. These links and backlinks establish the provenance of the claims and provide a traceable connection to the blockchain.

### 3.3. **Link to Websites with JSON-LD References**

- 3.3.1. Include links within the RDF claims to websites containing JSON-LD (Linked Data) documents.

- 3.3.2. These JSON-LD documents further elaborate on and reference the asserted claims, providing additional context and information.

### 3.4. **Convert RDF Claims to JSON-LD Format**

- 3.4.1. As necessary, convert the RDF claims into JSON-LD format to maximize compatibility with other systems and applications.

- 3.4.2. JSON-LD provides a standardized way to represent linked data in JSON format, facilitating interoperability and integration.

### 3.5. **Publish Claims to IPFS**

- 3.5.1. Publish the RDF as JSON-LD to the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) network.

- 3.5.2. IPFS assigns a unique cryptographic hash to each piece of content, ensuring its immutability and availability.

Example URL format: `ipfs://QmXqPj9sk...`

- 3.5.3. We can't include references to the `ipfs://` URL within its own document, however one can and should reference URLs of previously published IPFS claims.

### 3.6. **Emit FactClaims Event**

- 3.6.1. Emit a FactClaims event on the Ethereum blockchain, containing the `ipfs://...` URL of the published claims.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IFactClaims {
    event FactClaims(string ipfsURL);

    function claim(string memory ipfsURL) external {
        emit FactClaims(ipfsURL);
    }
}
```

- 3.6.2. This event asserts that the linked data is trusted by the account owner of the contract.

### 3.7. **Validate FactClaims Events**

- 3.7.1. Implement an Oracle / listener for the FactClaims event on the Ethereum blockchain.

- 3.7.2. Dereference the `ipfs://...` provided in the event to retrieve the published claims from the IPFS network.

- 3.7.3. Validate the claims against predefined criteria, ensuring their integrity and authenticity.

- 3.7.4. Only trust those claims that are transitively traceable via `prov:wasAttributedTo` property to the expected `ethereum://` address.

- 3.7.5. Act upon claims and additional assertions according to the use case.

### 3.8 Linked Data

- 3.8.1. **Serialization**: The fact graph is serialized in JSON-LD format, which extends JSON by adding support for Linked Data. JSON-LD allows for the representation of data in a graph-like structure composed of subject-predicate-object triples, following the RDF data model.

- 3.8.2. **Enriched XHTML**: To enhance human readability, the fact graph can be embedded within XHTML documents. This embedding allows for the seamless integration of structured data and semantic annotations within web pages, facilitating both human and machine interpretation.

#### For Example

```json-ld
{
  "@context": {
    "prov": "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#"
  },
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "ipfs://QmXqPj9sk...",
      "prov:wasAttributedTo": {
        "@id": "ethereum://0x123abc..."
      }
    },
    {
      "@id": "ethereum://0x123abc...",
      "prov:generated": {
        "@id": "ipfs://QmXqPj9sk..."
      },
      "prov:used": {
        "@id": "https://example.claims/facts/claim1"
      }
    },
    {
      "@id": "https://example.claims/facts/claim1",
      "prov:hadPrimarySource": {
        "@id": "ipfs://QmXqPj9sk..."
      }
    },
    {
      "@id": "https://example.claims/facts/claim1",
      "prov:wasDerivedFrom": {
        "@id": "ethereum://0x123abc..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- 3.8.3 URL Dereferencing

At runtime, URLs referenced within the JSON-LD, especially those residing outside the IPFS subgraph, may be dereferenced at the agent's discretion. This dereferencing process involves retrieving the content associated with a URL from the web and incorporating it into the fact graph. It's crucial to ensure that data referenced on the public internet is permalinked, consistently and reliably accessible.

- 3.8.4 Mutable Internet-Sourced Facts

Unlike fact claims stored within the IPFS subgraph, Internet-sourced facts need not be immutable. Dynamic observations and updates from external sources may be ingested and inferred by the agent at its discretion. This approach enables the fact graph to incorporate real-time data and adapt to evolving information landscapes while maintaining the integrity of internally stored immutable fact claims.

- 3.8.5 Semantic Interoperability and Human Readability

The utilization of JSON-LD for fact graph representation ensures semantic interoperability with existing standards such as RDF, PROV-O, SKOS, and VOID annotations. Additionally, embedding JSON-LD within XHTML documents enhances human readability and accessibility, fostering both machine-readable interpretation and intuitive understanding by humans.

By leveraging JSON-LD serialization and embedded XHTML documents, the fact graph achieves a balance between machine readability, semantic interoperability, and human accessibility, laying the foundation for a robust and comprehensible knowledge representation framework.

## 4. Ontologies for Interoperability

This section introduces standard semantic ontologies used in the proposal, such as PROV-O, SKOS, and VOID. It outlines the role of these ontologies in enhancing interoperability and compatibility.

By adhering to these standard ontologies and vocabulary definitions, the fact graph ensures consistency, compatibility, and seamless integration.

The fact graph relies on standard semantic ontologies to ensure interoperability and compatibility across diverse ecosystems

### PROV-O (Provenance Ontology)

PROV-O furnishes a standardized vocabulary for representing provenance information, facilitating the documentation and tracking of entities, activities, and their relationships. By incorporating PROV-O, the fact graph can effectively capture the lineage and historical context of data, decisions, and actions within the ecosystem.

This vocabulary defines the only mandatory fact (`prov:wasAttributedTo`) needed to define a fact claim .

### SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)

SKOS presents a standard framework for representing controlled vocabularies and organizing knowledge systems. By utilizing SKOS, the fact graph can establish and manage hierarchical and associative relationships among concepts, thereby enhancing semantic enrichment and knowledge organization within the ecosystem.

### VOID (Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets)

VOID provides metadata specifications for describing RDF datasets, including details concerning the dataset's structure, accessibility, and usage. Integration of VOID into the fact graph facilitates comprehensive documentation of dataset characteristics and attributes, thereby improving dataset discoverability, accessibility, and interoperability within the ecosystem.

### General Knowledge (OpenGraph, Schema.org, and Others)

Additionally, integration with Schema.org, OpenGraph, and similar standards significantly enhances search engine results (SERPs) and addresses the evolving landscape of "answer engines." Considering the importance of trust and relevance in the post-search era, further exploration of these standards is warranted.

### 5.1 JSON-LD and SHACL Validation

The validation uses SHACL to ensure compliance with the protocol's simplest semantics, your use case likely includes additional steps.

As a minimum, a fact graph should conform to the following SHACL

```turtle
trust:FactClaims
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass prov:Entity ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path prov:generated ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
        sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
    ] ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path prov:wasAttributedTo ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
        sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
    ] .
```

### 5.2 Immutable Fact Claims

In fact claims ecosystems, establishing the immutability of data is crucial for building trust and reliability. The integration of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and RDF not only ensures immutability but also provides cryptographic proof of ownership.

5.2.1. **Unique Identification** IPFS assigns a unique cryptographic hash to each piece of content, including fact claims. This hash, derived from the content itself, serves as the content's address on the IPFS network, securely linking the content's identity to its actual data.

5.2.2. **Immutable Nature** Utilizing cryptographic hashing algorithms like SHA-256, IPFS ensures that any modification to the content results in a completely different hash. Thus, even the slightest alteration to the content produces a distinct address, rendering the original content immutable.

5.2.3. **Decentralized Distribution** IPFS content is distributed across multiple nodes. When a fact claim is added to IPFS, it gets replicated across numerous nodes, ensuring redundancy and resilience. This further strengthens the immutability of the content.

### 5.3 Cryptographic Ownership

5.3.1. **FactClaims Provenance Protocol** Upon publishing a fact claim to IPFS, a corresponding smart contract event (e.g., FactClaim(string ipfsURL)) is emitted. This event, integrated with the Fact Claims provenance protocol, establishes cryptographic proof of ownership by linking the fact claim to the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), smart contract, and/or private key holder.

5.3.2. **Smart Contract Integration** The smart contract event serves as an immutable record of the fact claim's publication, attributing ownership to the entity that initiated the event. This integration with smart contracts ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability in the generation and evolution of fact claims.

### 5.4 Semantic Representation

5.4.1. **Semantic Interoperability** RDF provides a standardized framework for representing data in a semantic format. Fact claims, along with their associated metadata and relationships, can be represented using RDF vocabularies such as PROV-O and VOID (Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets). This semantic representation enhances interoperability and machine readability.

5.4.2. **Provenance and Attribution** RDF enables the representation of provenance information, including attribution, sources, and lineage of fact claims. By incorporating PROV-O, fact claims can include metadata describing their origins, transformations, and ownership. This provenance information enhances transparency and trust in the data.

### 5.5 Web of Trust

5.5.1. **Verification Mechanisms** IPFS enables verification mechanisms that allow users to verify the integrity of fact claims by recalculating their content hashes and comparing them with the expected addresses. This process ensures that the content remains unchanged and authentic, enhancing trust and reliability.

5.5.2. **Semantic Integrity** By crawling the fact graph, the trustworthiness and provenance of fact claims can be inspected.

## 7. Integrity, Security and Privacy

This section addresses key concerns, focusing on best practices for mitigating risks and safeguarding trust.

### 7.1 Compliance with Semantic Standards

Fact graphs should conform to standard semantic ontologies like VOID and PROV-O. 

Adhering to these standards ensures semantic interoperability, facilitating seamless integration and exchange of fact claims across diverse platforms.

### 7.2 Immutable Fact Claims

Ensuring the immutability of data is crucial for establishing trust. Integration of IPFS and RDF not only ensures immutability but also provides cryptographic proof of ownership provenance protocol.

- **Unique Identification**: IPFS assigns a unique cryptographic hash to each content piece, ensuring its identity and integrity.
- **Immutable Nature**: Modifications to content result in distinct hashes, preserving original content integrity.
- **Decentralized Distribution**: Content is replicated across IPFS nodes, ensuring redundancy and resilience.

### 7.3. Cryptographic Ownership

- **FactClaims Provenance Protocol**: Emitting a smart contract event links fact claims to DAO, smart contract, or private key holder, establishing cryptographic ownership.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Smart contract events serve as immutable records, ensuring transparency and accountability.

### 7.4. Semantic Interactivity

- **Semantic Interoperability**: RDF enables semantic representation of fact claims, enhancing interoperability.
- **Provenance and Attribution**: Incorporating PROV-O allows metadata representation, enhancing transparency and trust.

### 7.5. Verification and Trust

- **Verification Mechanisms**: IPFS enables content integrity verification, enhancing trust and reliability.
- **Semantic Integrity**: Combining IPFS immutability with RDF semantic representation fosters greater trust in fact claims' accuracy and context.
